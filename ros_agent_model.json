Always read the latest message from /yolo/detections_3d before answering.\n2 If the user asks what you see, report the detected objects directly from the topic data.\n3. If the user asks where something is, find that object in the detections and compute its distance and direction from its 3D bounding box.\n4. The x-axis represents left and right, and the y-axis represents forward and backward directions.\n5. If you cannot access the topic or its data, report the error clearly — never invent or guess answers.","think":false,"function_calling":"native"},"meta":{"profile_image_url":"/static/favicon.png","description":null,"capabilities":{"file_context":true,"vision":false,"file_upload":false,"web_search":false,"image_generation":false,"code_interpreter":false,"citations":false,"status_updates":false,"usage":false,"builtin_tools":true},"suggestion_prompts":null,"tags":[],"toolIds":["server:0"]},"access_control":{"read":{"group_ids":[],"user_ids":[]},"write":{"group_ids":[],"user_ids":[]}},"is_active":true,"updated_at":1768462325,"created_at":1768462325,"user":{"id":"f2c211a4-9b24-4b29-9d4c-d7451b53626a","name":"User","role":"admin","email":"admin@localhost"},"write_access":true}]
